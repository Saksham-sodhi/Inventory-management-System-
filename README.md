# Inventory-management-System-



## Overview
The **Inventory Management System** is a Python-based application designed to help businesses manage their inventory efficiently. It allows users to add, edit, and delete products, track inventory levels, and generate reports.

## Features
- **User Authentication**: Secure login system with password hashing.
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, update, delete, and view inventory items.
- **Inventory Tracking**: Keep track of stock levels.
- **Reporting**: Generate reports for sales and low-stock alerts.
- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Simple and interactive interface using Tkinter.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database for storing inventory data.
- **Tkinter**: GUI framework for creating the user interface.
- **bcrypt**: Secure password hashing for authentication.
- **Pandas**: Used for generating reports.

## Installation
### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Saksham-sodhi/inventory-management.git
cd inventory-management
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)
```sh
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # For Mac/Linux
env\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### 1. Run the Application
```sh
python main.py
```
### 2. Add Products
